Overview
This project implements a microservices-based online bookstore using Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, Spring Security, Netflix Eureka, and MySQL. It follows a distributed architecture, incorporating service discovery, an API Gateway, and seamless inter-service communication for managing books, processing orders, and tracking inventory.
Key Features
Microservices Architecture: Independent services for books, orders, and inventory.

Service Discovery: Dynamic registration and lookup with Netflix Eureka.

API Gateway: Centralized request routing via Spring Cloud Gateway.

Database: MySQL for persistent data storage using JPA/Hibernate.

API Documentation: Interactive API exploration using Swagger UI.

Testing: Thorough API testing with Postman.

Architecture Overview
The system consists of multiple microservices:

Eureka Server: Manages service registration and discovery.

API Gateway: Acts as the single entry point for client requests.

Book Service: Handles book-related CRUD operations.

Order Service: Manages order processing and tracking.

Inventory Service: Maintains stock levels for books.
